What's Next? is a shopping list app for iOS devices. This is currently the MVP and more functionality is planning to be added in the near future

## Usage

The app also includes the option to add the price of the items that you plan on getting and gives you the total price of your shop. Ideal for adding items in as you shop and seeing how much your shop will cost before scanning your items at the checkout.
